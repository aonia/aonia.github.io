                What is agile in general
            </h2>
            <p dir="ltr">
            The world is going agile! After publishing an agile    <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">manifesto</a> back in 2001, this word
                traveled all over the world and united IT companies and professionals
                around the methodology that fundamentally changed the creation of software
                and it’s delivery to the client.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Instead of spending months or years developing product and then presenting
                it to the client, risking that product and requirements won’t exactly meet,
                agile focuses on close collaboration, frequent communication and continuous
                improvement which in the end gives desired results to both sides.
            </p>
            <h2 dir="ltr">
                How it transformed IT business and project management
            </h2>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Agile changed how companies thought about delivering service to the client.
                In today's commercial world, where competitiveness is the key, not to
                succeed but to survival, agile approach became “the force” which guarantees
                that company will deliver requested value to the customer.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Through the years this approach has developed in many ways and in many
                forms like: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming… this so called frameworks
                differ from each other with their practices, but the main purposes, that
                transformed IT businesses remains the same:

            </ul>
            <h2 dir="ltr">
                How it can be used for non-IT business
            </h2>
            <p dir="ltr">
                As an outcome of agile approach and technological breakthrough, all of us
                benefit from a well designed, user centered and fully functional websites,
                mobile apps, gadgets etc.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                So why can’t we use agile for non-IT businesses to create non-software
                products?
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                It turns out, we can! With today's online tools, freely available to us, we
                can transform our old-fashioned approaches to modern methods, and the FBI's
                case is the proof.
            </p>
            <h3 dir="ltr">
                It’s proved by the FBI!
            </h3>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Government agencies also can use agile.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                FBI needed case management to be more digital and flexible, instead of
                papers which arose lots of problems, but the main motivation for “let’s not
                use papers anymore” was 9/11 precendent, when FBI desired to send lots of
                data rapidly, but because of risk that data could be hijacked, they used
                faxes and CD-ROMs. That’s why Congress approved a multi million initiative.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Because of the complexity of the scope of work the main contractor failed
                to do requirements analysis and that resulted in poor design and incorrect
                functionality. After three years of work, the cost of hundreds of thousands
                of lines of code was more than $600 million, and still the project was way
                far from being even adequate.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                After such a failure, the bureau decided to manage everything internally.
                The newly chosen CIO, Chad Fulgham, decided that agile can become a hero in
                this project. He used the most popular framework, Scrum, and with: two week
                sprints, sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint retrospective and other
                <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/guide-to-scrum-ceremonies">
                    scrum ceremonies
                </a>
                , new CIO managed to develop and deploy software solution in just 16
                months, with just $26 million budget. Incremental approach ensured
                accelerated software deliverables and adjustments for developed
                functionality.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                So, agile works!
            </p>
            <h2 dir="ltr">
                Example with Trello
            </h2>
            <p dir="ltr">
                This article mainly focuses on the Kanban framework of agile approach and
                free online tool called <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. With
                those things in mind, you can probably organize everything, so, now it’s
                time to take a closer look.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Kanban is one the most popular framework of agile methodology, which mainly
                focuses on incremental and evolutionary changes to the current process.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Using Kanban is very easy and you can start using it right away, with just
                board and sticky notes, but if you are planning for close collaboration and
                real-time communication, Trello is here to help you and here is example
                how:

            <p dir="ltr">
                Don’t be confused if it seems too overloaded at first sight, by the time
                you will even find comfort in more complex boards of yours. (It’s a heaven
                for perfectionists)
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                This is a high-level overview of the sample company. As you see there are
                several <b>lists</b>: <i>Teams, Up Next, Current Projects, Completed Projects and
                Bravos</i>. And inside of those lists we have <b>cards</b>, for example Current
                Projects have cards called Analytics Data.
            </p>
            <br/>

                        Lists - they represent stages you might have in your company,

                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Cards - are synonyms of “work” in Kanban, cards describe what has
                        to be done, when and by whom.
                    </p>

                Depending your needs and specification names and quantity of the lists
